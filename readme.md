update -- It's back!!!


Yeah at 3 am after hours of cleaning up and trying to add it to github, I had an non existant file that stop pushing. So I asked how to remove files from github history and i got how to remove, end of sentence. 

here's a command you should never do: git filter-repo --path <path-to-remove> --invert-paths --force

Testdisk didn't help much, but luckily, i had a backup in hidden in my system partition somewhere that was rather recent.

I'm kinda doxing myself but hey... Let's rip the bandaid
My name is François, I live in Québec, Canada. If you didn't get the Poutine au Sirop D'érable, now you do. 
|| So basically, it's like an american called "Gun wielding bald Eagle", british->"Tea drinking coloniser", Australian->"Inverted Jailed Kangouroos". ||

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Quebec

So with that, my profile pic is explained. 


So, I'll upload a ~/home directories so you can reproduce this.
Pictures, Videos, .mpd and other are needed. (Python_main_Environment)
Music Too

Though I'll have to remove the songs due to copy right reasons. 

also main problem is lots of these files have /home/francois, at some point i might switch it to $HOME.
